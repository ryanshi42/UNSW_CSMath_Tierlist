# UNSW_CSMath_Tierlist

These are merely my own opinions and I intend to update them whenever I can :)). Also the main purpose of this list is to track what courses I've done / found useful rather than of being pedagogical in any way.

These are not ranked in order in tiers btw. Also I didn't spend too much time on the tier list so some maybe inaccurate especially in the A or B tier range.
